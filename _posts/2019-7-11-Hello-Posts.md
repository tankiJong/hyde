## Markdown support as the original framework.

Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](https://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

### Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

### [Math Test](https://haixing-hu.github.io/programming/2013/09/20/how-to-use-mathjax-in-jekyll-generated-github-pages/)

Let's test some inline math $x$, $y$, $x_1$, $y_1$.

Now a inline math with special character: $|\psi\rangle$, $x'$, $x^\*$.

Test a display math:
$$
   |\psi_1\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle
$$
Is it O.K.?

Test a display math with equation number:
\begin{equation}
   |\psi_1\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle
\end{equation}
Is it O.K.?

Test a display math with equation number in \eqref{eq:eq2}:
$$
  \begin{align}
    |\psi_1\rangle &= a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle \\\\
    |\psi_2\rangle &= c|0\rangle + d|1\rangle
    \label{eq:eq2}
  \end{align}
$$
Is it O.K.?

And test a display math without equaltion number:
\begin{align\*}
    |\psi_1\rangle &= a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle \\\\
    |\psi_2\rangle &= c|0\rangle + d|1\rangle
\end{align\*}
